Online cheating detection using AI and React Js

Online-Proctoring-System
Online Courses greatly expand the reach of todays educational institutions, both by provid- ing a wider range of educational resources to enrolled students and by making educational resources available to persons who cannot access a campus due to location or schedule con- straints. Exams are a critical component of any educational program, and online educational programs are no exception. In any exam, there is a possibility of cheating, and therefore its detection and prevention is important. According to a survey about 29% of the students admitted cheating. When exams are administered in a conventional and proctored classroom environment, the students are mon- itored by a human proctor throughout the exam. The overall goal of this system is to maintain academic integrity of exams, by providing real-time proctoring to detect the ma- jority of cheating behaviors of the test taker. To achieve such goals, audio-visual observations about the test takers are required to be able to detect any cheat behavior. Our system monitors some signs in the room where the test taker resides, using two cameras and a microphone. The first camera is the webcam of laptop itself. The other camera can be a smartphone camera. The microphone is the built in microphone of laptop, So no extra hardware is required on behalf of student to give the exam. Using such sensors, we propose to detect the following cheat behaviors:

cheat from text books/notes/papers,
using a phone to call a friend,
asking a friend in the test room, and
having another person take the exam other than the test take
This project has the following features:

Proposes an automated online exam proctoring system with visual and audio sensors for the purpose of detecting cheating.
Collects a multimedia dataset of images of student from both the cameras during exams and also the dataset of anomalous behaviours of student.
